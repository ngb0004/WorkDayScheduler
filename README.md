# WorkDayScheduler

Created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updating HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Used Moment API to keep track of the time and determine past present and future to apply styles in css.

I got better at working with javascript but I think I still coud have found better ways to store the text in local storage.

I was very proud that I was able to create the logic that changes the class to past present and future. I don't know if it was done in the ideal way but I thought it was relatively creative.

I did my best to write in comments so that you could sort of see where things were going. The only place that might be confusing is with the saveBtn, I got really confused with the logic after I added the save icon and my code fell apart but I was able to add a new ID to the icon instead of the entire button which solved the issue.
